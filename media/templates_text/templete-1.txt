Hello [Name],

I’m glad to see things are going well and that business is starting to pick up. Andrea shared your outstanding numbers from Tuesday—great work, and please keep it up.

Turning to other business, I’d like to discuss a payment schedule for the outstanding amounts currently due.

First, would you be able to pay the remaining balance of the license agreement as soon as possible?

Second, regarding the back royalties, I’d like to propose setting up a structured payment plan. Please let me know what you feel comfortable with—whether payments every two weeks or monthly would work best for you.

Going forward, my goal is for us to catch up on past balances while also maintaining current royalties. If possible, I would appreciate starting regular payments on current royalties every two weeks, in line with the standard schedule followed by all stores.

Please let me know if this proposal works for you, or feel free to suggest an alternative arrangement that you believe is manageable.

I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
