The Origin of the Idea

The idea for this project began after I watched Harvey Mackay speak at one of Harv Eker’s events. When he mentioned that he had just completed the Boston Marathon at 76 years old, it stopped me cold. He looked fit, sharp, and mentally quick, and it made me wonder whether the way he lives—especially the way he eats—plays a role in sustaining that level of energy and clarity.

How the Project Evolved

What started as three core questions asked to every guest quickly took on a life of its own. Each person approached the questions from a different angle, and I realized their insights were naturally forming the chapters of this book. This isn’t about simply transcribing conversations; it’s about real contribution, where each participant adds their own voice, experience, and perspective.

Setting the Conversation

I begin by introducing each guest and inviting them to add anything they feel is important to their background. From there, the discussion opens into how success, relationships, energy, and lifestyle intersect—particularly how nutrition and daily habits impact performance in a demanding, fast-paced professional life.

The Central Question

At the heart of every conversation is the same underlying idea: whether food and lifestyle choices influence long-term success. While many successful people eat poorly, the recurring theme has been that sustained energy, focus, and presence—especially for those who speak frequently and maintain hectic schedules—are difficult to maintain without intentional habits.
